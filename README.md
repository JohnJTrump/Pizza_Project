# Pizza_Project

The Pizza Project is an example of a form which can be used 
to order items with different features. 

This specific page gives the user the ability to choose
toppings to put on a pizza with multiple radio style buttons.

Each check box is connected to a function which assigns it a 
monitary value. After a user has selected everything they 
would like on their pizza they are able to submit their 
order and a bill will be generated with the total cost.
